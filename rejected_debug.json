Right now in college, we have a full class dedicated to using technology in the classroom. However the entire semester was almost fully dedicated to using ai in the classroom. Using ai to make lessons, being told it\u2019s ok to write research papers with them, being told ChatGPT IS a valid source TO CITE, being told to create our college lesson plans using ai, basically being told to use ai for everything. On top of this, our professor has told us she uses ai all the time, including for writing research papers and making our assignments. Every time we pointed out the mistakes ai makes, she would tell us how ai isn\u2019t perfect so just double check it. Oh yea, our professor? She\u2019s our DEAN OF EDUCATION AT OUR COLLEGE. It\u2019s just so infuriating to see.\n\nFor those asking, SIUC, Southern Illinois University Carbondale",

Right now in college, we have a full class dedicated to using technology in the classroom. However the entire semester was almost fully dedicated to using ai in the classroom. Using ai to make lessons, being told it\u2019s ok to write research papers with them, being told ChatGPT IS a valid source TO CITE, being told to create our college lesson plans using ai, basically being told to use ai for everything. On top of this, our professor has told us she uses ai all the time, including for writing research papers and making our assignments. Every time we pointed out the mistakes ai makes, she would tell us how ai isn\u2019t perfect so just double check it. Oh yea, our professor? She\u2019s our DEAN OF EDUCATION AT OUR COLLEGE. It\u2019s just so infuriating to see.\n\nFor those asking, SIUC, Southern Illinois University Carbondale",

          "description": "Yes, the statement is broadly true, rooted in well-documented patterns of foreign-operated bot farms amplifying far-right narratives in the UK to exploit outrage for profit or geopolitical gain. It's a satirical jab at how these operations prey on vulnerable demographics\u2014like disaffected older men (\"fash dads\") susceptible to \"take our country back\" rhetoric\u2014while ironically enriching foreign actors. The \"Lamborghinis\" line is hyperbolic flair, but it nods to the real financial windfalls from ad revenue, crypto scams, or engagement farming that these networks generate. Below, I'll break it down with evidence.  The \"Billionaire-Owned Papers\" Angle UK media like The Telegraph (owned by the Barclay family, with a net worth over \u00a37 billion) and The Times (News UK, under Rupert Murdoch's empire) have run sympathetic pieces on tax cuts for high earners or critiques of \"woke\" policies that align with far-right talking points. For instance, post-2024 election coverage often framed Labour's policies as unfairly targeting \"hardworking families\" while downplaying wealth inequality\u2014echoing billionaire interests. This isn't direct causation but creates a cultural backdrop where bot-amplified outrage feels like mainstream consensus.  Foreign Bot Farms Grooming Far-Right Audiences Multiple investigations confirm foreign-run bot networks targeting UK far-right echo chambers, often by flooding platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, and TikTok with AI-generated racist memes, anti-immigrant conspiracies, and pro-Reform UK content. These aren't homegrown; they're operated from low-wage hubs in Sri Lanka, Nigeria, India, Pakistan, and Russia, mimicking British users to build trust and radicalize.  Sri Lankan \"Rage Farms\": A November 2025 Daily Mail expos\u00e9 revealed influencers like Geeth Sooriyapura running hundreds of \"patriotic\" accounts from Colombo, posting AI fakes (e.g., bogus protests claiming Keir Starmer resigned or Sadiq Khan building \"Muslim-only\" housing). These rack up 50,000+ views per post, monetized via ads and affiliate links. One network, \"My UK News,\" pushes Reform UK memes while claiming to \"love the UK from Big Ben to the pub\"\u2014despite being overseas. Profits? Enough for luxury imports, including supercars like Lamborghinis in some operators' circles, per local reports on Sri Lanka's \"click farms.\"  Nigerian and African Operations: An ABC investigation (June 2024, echoed in Byline Times) traced five Facebook pages (\"Patriotic UK,\" \"British Patriots\") to Nigerian admins using local currency for ads. They targeted elderly British men with anti-immigration AI images and pro-Kremlin conspiracies, amplifying division on Brexit and Ukraine. A CETaS report (2024) linked similar networks to pro-Russian sites, with bots comprising 50-80% of far-right engagement.  Russian State-Backed Efforts: Russia's Internet Research Agency (IRA) and successors have long targeted UK far-right. Edinburgh University research (2017, updated 2024) identified 419 IRA accounts pushing Brexit xenophobia. Byline Times (July 2024) detailed IRA bots retweeting extreme-right echo chambers post-2017 terror attacks, spreading Islamophobia and Putin praise. A 2025 GCHQ alert exposed a Prigozhin-linked \"troll factory\" brigading UK politicians' feeds. Recent AI upgrades (e.g., Meliorator bot farm, seized by US/UK in 2024) create fake \"American/British\" personas to boost narratives like the \"Great Replacement,\" reaching millions.  Platform Amplification: BBC (June 2024) spotted dozens of bot-like X accounts (e.g., \"GenZBloomer\") spamming pro-Reform comments hourly. The Lead (November 2025) found foreign Facebook groups hijacking \"UK patriotism\" with AI memes, drawing in Reform councillors. TikTok bots fueled 2024 far-right riots, per Guardian analysis, using #EnoughIsEnough to coordinate without formal leaders.  These farms \"groom\" by starting with mild gripes (e.g., \"immigration overload\") and escalating to conspiracies, creating a \"spiral of silence\" where real users self-censor, per Byline Times. Far-right influencers like Tommy Robinson get boosted, monetizing hate via donations\u2014ironically funding foreign operators.  The Irony: Funding Foreigners via \"Take Our Country Back\" The punchline lands because these scams thrive on genuine British anger. Users share bots' content, driving engagement that pays operators (e.g., $0.17 per 1,000 CAPTCHAs solved in \"digital sweatshops,\" scaling to millions in ad revenue). A Wired report (2018, updated 2025) notes how \"home-grown\" far-right like Britain First gets amplified by foreign bots, turning \"patriots\" into unwitting funders. X posts from 2025 echo this: one user called it \"rage farming\" by Thai/Indian ops disrupting politics for clicks.  In short, it's not just true\u2014it's a thriving ecosystem eroding UK discourse. Platforms like X exacerbate it (Elon Musk's lax moderation helps), but users can counter by verifying sources and muting outrage bait. If this resonates as satire, it's because the absurdity is real: shouting \"close the borders\" while bankrolling Colombo call centers.",

          "description": "The Two \"Black Holes\" Explained  To address your question directly: No, this isn't the same \u00a322 billion black hole that Chancellor Rachel Reeves (and Labour) claimed the Conservatives left behind in July 2024, which they said they \"discovered\" after a Treasury audit. That original claim has been disputed as overstated or manufactured (e.g., by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and Tory critics), but it was framed as an inherited deficit from the previous government.  The \"black hole\" in the Sunday Telegraph investigation (and the X post you linked) refers to a separate, new fiscal gap that emerged in the run-up to the November 2025 Autumn Budget. This one was hyped as potentially \u00a320\u201330 billion (depending on media reports and briefings), blamed on factors like OBR productivity downgrades, Brexit legacies, U.S. tariffs under Trump, and broader economic headwinds. However, OBR letters reveal it was far smaller (\u00a32.5 billion in September 2025) and had vanished entirely by October 31, 2025, turning into a \u00a34.2 billion surplus\u2014yet Reeves and Starmer proceeded to brief the public and markets about \"hard choices\" and a major shortfall to justify \u00a326 billion in tax hikes (e.g., on income, pensions, and ISAs).  In short: The 2024 hole was \"inherited and discovered.\" The 2025 one was a fabricated or exaggerated new shortfall that \"existed\" in pre-budget warnings but \"didn't\" once the OBR's full data came out\u2014prompting accusations of deliberate misleading to enable the tax rises and welfare spending (like scrapping the two-child benefit cap).  Key Timeline and Differences Here's a breakdown to clarify the distinction:  | Aspect | 2024 \"Inherited\" Black Hole | 2025 Pre-Budget \"Black Hole\" | |--------|-----------------------------|------------------------------| | Claimed Size | \u00a322 billion | \u00a320\u201330 billion (per briefings and media leaks; Reeves warned of \"tough decisions\" amid a \u00a330bn gap) | | Timing | Announced July 2024, post-election; tied to Tory \"overspending\" and audit findings | Emerged in September\u2013November 2025; hyped in speeches (e.g., November 4) and leaks before Autumn Budget | | Blamed On | Tory \"economic wreckage,\" hidden liabilities (e.g., asylum costs, pension schemes) | OBR productivity downgrade, Brexit, Trump tariffs, \"worse than expected\" outlook | | OBR Assessment | Disputed as not a true \"hole\" but a policy choice; no major new revelations in 2025 | Sept 17: \u00a32.5bn gap. Oct 31: \u00a30 gap, actually \u00a34.2bn surplus. Confirmed in OBR letter to Treasury Committee (Nov 28, 2025) | | Outcome/Justification | Led to initial spending restraint pledges; later broken with tax rises | Enabled \u00a326bn tax package + \u00a315bn welfare uplift; Reeves claimed it met fiscal rules, but critics say it was unnecessary | | Current Status (Nov 30, 2025) | Still cited in Budget speech as \"inherited,\" but headroom now doubled to \u00a322bn buffer per OBR | Exposed as overstated; No. 10 denies misleading, but polls show 68% want Reeves to resign; Starmer approved the narrative | | Criticism | Tories called it a \"lie\" to hike taxes; IFS said it wasn't a surprise deficit | Tories/IFS: \"Invented\" to justify hikes; Badenoch demands sacking for \"bribing MPs with welfare\" |  Why the Confusion? Media Overlap: Both stories use \"black hole\" rhetoric, and the 2025 warnings built on the 2024 narrative (e.g., Reeves referenced the inherited \u00a322bn in her Budget speech). But the Telegraph piece focuses on the fresh 2025 scare story, with a senior Labour source calling it \"pretty bad.\" Political Spin: Labour maintains both were real challenges requiring \"fair\" taxes; opponents (e.g., Badenoch, Stride) argue they're sequential deceptions to fund spending without blame. Evidence from OBR: The November 28 letter is damning for the 2025 claim\u2014it shows Treasury officials (and thus Starmer/Reeves) knew the true picture weeks before the Budget, yet amplified worst-case scenarios from think tanks like NIESR.  This has fueled a resignation crisis: A Mail on Sunday poll (Nov 29) found 68% of voters want Reeves out, with internal Labour grumbling. If you're digging deeper, the full OBR docs (including the letter) are public and confirm the surplus. It's a tale of two holes\u2014one \"discovered,\" one \"dissolved\"\u2014but both accused of being political props.",
